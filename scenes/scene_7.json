This amulet,' she held it out, its intricate designs catching the dim light, casting glimmers around the room, 'was your father's, passed through generations. It's not just a pretty neckless; it's reservoir of ancient powers. If misused, it's a serious danger to the user and others. Our ancestors bound a fraction of their essence into this very amulet. With it, you can call forth their wisdom, strength, and powers.'",
