Their quaint farm stood outside of town amidst rolling hills and shimmering lakes. Kael's days danced byâ€”each morning, he'd chase after butterflies, fish by the babbling brook, or construct elaborate forts. By noon he'd practice mock archery, dreaming of big adventures. Come evening, Aunt Maela would share tales of their ancestors under the starlit sky.",
